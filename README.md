## Flow Blockchain 
<h3>Flow Blockchain was used in order to securely authenticate users across platforms, as well as keep user profiles stored on the blockchain. This decentralization takes load off of our servers, and gives users more power over their own data.</h3>

## Redis

<h3> Redis was used as a low latency key value store in order to store, retrieve, and update live game state. Redis Cloud and Stack were used to update game values in real time, and provide high availability to our game server. </h3>
